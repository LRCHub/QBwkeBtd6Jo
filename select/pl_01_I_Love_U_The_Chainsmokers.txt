いけいけ 団長！
頑張れ 頑張れ 団長！
In the range outside and I'm
thinking about loose ends
Even though we cut ties,
I don't wanna be just friends
From the day I got your
number like Paris in the summer
it ends
Every day that goes by,
I wish I was in your bed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Oh God
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Trying to find a reason
why we can't work this out
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Oh my God
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's hard to find a reason
why we can't work this out
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I love you
Oh my God
You were on the West side,
I was driving down the I-10
And the song came on,
got me thinking
who you chose instead
Oh, I never thought twice,
but I wonder what you see
in them
Another day goes by that
I can't get you out of my head
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Oh God
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Trying to find a reason
why we can't work this out
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Oh my God
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's hard to find a reason
why we can't work this out
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(I love you)
When it hits, I'm convinced
that you know it's not over
All my love's counterfeit,
unless you're coming over
Do you think of my voice
when your city gets colder?
